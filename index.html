            <p>I am 29 years old, I am from Mexico City, I love videogames and I had no pictures of myself. Sorry about
                that.</p>
            <p>I am studying a presencial degree while studying in Pathway, and it is starting to get hard, but I am
                shure I will handle it with a little more of proper time managment.</p>
            <p>I just have to spend less time playing my beloved videogames and sleep better.</p>
            <p>I am very introvert, so I'd like just to paste a "lorem ipsum" here so the image on the right gets well
                aligned, but I think that's not going to happen, and because of my lack of social life, I think maybe I
                should talk more about my love for videogames, right?</p>
            <p>My Steam account has over 700 games purchased, and my favorite genre is the so-called "Soulslike", I
                enjoy making things difficult for myself and overcoming great obstacles with the bare minimum available
                resources in the game. Oh, I think I finally have enough text!</p>

            <p>Mexico City is the capital of Mexico, a high-altitude and densely populated city. It is famous for its
                Templo Mayor (a 13th-century Aztec temple), the baroque-style Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral built
                by the Spanish conquistadors, and the National Palace, which houses historic murals by Diego Rivera. All
                of these sights are concentrated around the Plaza de la Constitución, the huge main square also known as
                the Zócalo.</p>
